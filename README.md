# Gradebook CLI (Python Project)

A command-line gradebook application built in Python.  
This project demonstrates **object-oriented programming, file persistence, CSV handling, and GPA calculation logic** — suitable for showcasing technical skills on a resume or GitHub portfolio.

## 🔹 Key Technical Highlights

- **Python (3.8+)** – implemented entirely with the standard library (no external dependencies).  
- **Object-Oriented Design** – `Student` and `Gradebook` classes encapsulate data and behavior.  
- **File Persistence** – automatic saving/loading of grade data to a CSV file.  
- **CLI Application** – interactive text-based menu for usability.  
- **Algorithmic Logic** – GPA scale conversion (A=4, B=3, etc.) from numerical averages.
